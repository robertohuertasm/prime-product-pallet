# Prime Product Pallet

The purpose of the pallet is to help users to define and solve the following problem:

With the equation

N = a * b

for a given uint N, find a and b, knowing both a and b are prime integers

Example:

Problem: N = 6

Solution: a = 2, b = 3

- Any user can submit new problem and set a non-zero reward for a solution.

- Any user can submit solution candidate for yet unsolved problem, and if correct, receive 80% of the problem's reward.

- The rest 20% of the reward stays in pallet's "treasury pool".

The following data should be stored on-chain:

- unsolved and solved problems,
- correct solutions.
